    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Our success came by complete accident.</br></br> It was not planned at all. </br></br></br> It all started one day as Pat was making his daily stroll down Pike Place eating his breakfast cookie, when all of a sudden, he tripped. While he was tripping, he tossed his cookie in the air. Not only was Pat's cookie flying in the air, there was a fish soaring through the air from the people at the Pike Place Fish Market. The two foods collided in the air, and then finally dropped to the floor as everyone gasped for air. Pat, a firm beleiver of the 5 second rule, ran back to his cookie. After taking a bite, the rest was history.
